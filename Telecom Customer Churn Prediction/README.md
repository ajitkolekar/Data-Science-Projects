<h2 align="center">Telecom Customer Churn Prediction</h2>
<p align="justify">Customer churn is when a customer decides to leave a company for a different service provider. In general, a telecom company has an annual churn rate of 15 to 25 percent. Attracting a new customer is always challenging and expensive compared to retaining existing customers. Understanding customer behavior and predicting when the customer could leave the company is important to know so that appropriate measures can be taken to retain such customers. Data science machine learning models can play a significant role in identifying customer behavior by using historical data. If the telecommunication company can use machine learning models to predict the potential customers that could leave the company, appropriate cost effective measures can be taken to retain such customers, since attracting new customers is very expensive compared to retaining existing customers.</p>
