<h2 align="center">Telecom Customer Churn Prediction</h2>
<p align="justify">Customer churn is when a customer decides to leave a company for a different service provider. In general, a telecom company has an annual churn rate of 15 to 25 percent. Attracting a new customer is always challenging and expensive compared to retaining existing customers. Understanding customer behavior and predicting when the customer could leave the company is important to know, so that appropriate measures can be taken to retain such customers. Machine learning models can play a significant role in identifying customer behavior using historical data and can predict potential possibility of the customers leaving the company.</p>
