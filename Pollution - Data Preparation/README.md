<h2 align="center">Pollution - Data Preparation</h2>
<p align="justify">An example of how Data Preparation is used to prepare data from multiple data sources, cleanse the data, merge the data using SQL joins, store the data in a database, and visualize the combined data. I used following three datasets for the purpose of this project.
<br/>
The first data set contains the daily data of air pollution for all counties in The United States. The data set focuses on four major pollutants: Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, and Ozone. 
<br/>
The second data set contains data of various pollutants impacting the air quality of all counties in The United States and the summary statistics of these pollutants. 
<br/>
The third data set contains counties and county equivalents of The United States, corresponding states, and their population. While there are only four columns, it is important to get the population by county to know how it impacts air pollution.</p>
