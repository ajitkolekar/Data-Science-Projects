<h2 align="center">Airline Safety - Data Visualization</h2>
<p align="justify">An example of how Data Visualization can be used as a technique for data storytelling. There is a lot of fear about flying in general public, so much so that people are avoiding to fly completely. They are choosing other travelling options over air travel, which is limiting their access to several beautiful places around the world. Risk of death is the primary reason why people try not to choose air travel. A lot of data supports the opposite of what these people think. The data confirms that airline travel is the safest way of travel. Visualization techniques used in this project help tell the story.</p>
